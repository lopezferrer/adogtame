Â¡Adogtame!

Project Description
General App Idea/Purpose: Adogtame is a pet adoption site for Venezuela. People can post pictures and information of animals they wish/need to give in adoption and other users can choose the pet best suited to them. The organization that will act as intermediary for the adoption will use this information to keep track of the animals, make sure that both the pets and the persons are safe throughout the whole process and provide support to pet-adopters, including data about the care required by different breeds as well as contact information for veterinarians in their area, articles, etc.


Technologies

I will use flask SQLite for the backend and React.js for the frontend. I will also use Google translate to provide automatic translation of the information contained in an API.

Installation:
Adogtame is a app designed to be deployed in the web.

MVP Goals Achieved

Create database of veterinarians and pet pharmacies still operating in the largest cities of Venezuela.

Stretch Goals
Create friendly backend with login for the administrators to be able to add more information to the site, such as articles, tips, contact information, etc. by themselves.

Highlights and difficulties:

I had a wonderful time making the database and deploying it to heroku. The front-end doesn't make justice to all the tables and layers I worked on. I also think the whole process was pretty easy to complete.
CSS is a pleasure to work with, it is very straight-forward and clear, and wish I had even more time to dedicate to it. I had a terrible time with the frontend, though. At the end, I managed to make every function of the app work perfectly but the login/logout function. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it work. I know this is was due to not having understood functional components well.
